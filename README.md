On the create page you will find a form field where the user will enter their name and any prompt they desire. If you are having trouble coming up with an idea, feel free to hit the random prompt generator. Open AI will then come up with an AI generated image that you can then post to the community page. Back on the homepage, each pic is saveable by clicking on the download icon and then saving the pic as you would a typical image file.
